1. Create 2 csv files emp.csv, dept.csv
2. fill the csvs with data for employees and departments (do not just dump via sql)
3. Using python program - write import.py script that can read both csvs and populate the emp and dept tables (db connectivity via python)
4. assume tables may already have data so so not delete existing data. just append it.
5. script should not fail abruptly due to issues with one or more records in csv, should continue and process next valid records
6. any errors or issues during the run should be logged to a output.log file
